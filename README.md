# My-Blog

_My-Blog_ is a personal blog built as an MPA with **Astro.js** and **SCSS**.

## Tech Stack

**Astro.js** feels much more than a framework. It literally lets you build and deploy an app with zero JavaScript _(by default)_, while also letting you choose between React.js, Vue.js, Svelte, and more, to create the best UI possible. \
For styling, I worked with **SCSS** and a _"7-1"_ personalized architecture that consists of only three folders: _\_abstracts, \_base, and \_components_, which is called by myself _'ABC' Architecture_. (This pattern might have different names but refers to the same thing: a _7-1ish SCSS architecture for smaller projects_.)

## Development Goals

- Build and deploy an static MPA with Astro.js
- Create an app with less JavaScript as possible, while ensuring user interactivity and smooth navigation
- Utilize the latest technologies and stay up-to-date with the industry standards
- Develop a user-friendly and responsible UI/UX
